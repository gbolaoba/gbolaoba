# - 👋 Hi, I’m @gbolaoba
## - 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics
- 🌱 I’ve just finished learning Data Analytics (Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau & Power BI) and Python Programming for Data Science (presently leveraging this to do Udemy's Deep Learning Prerequisites: Linear Regression In Python. & Applied Generative AI & Natural Language Processing).
